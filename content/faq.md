## What is Reminders+?

Reminders+ is a modern task and routine app designed to help you build consistency. Instead of overwhelming to-do lists, it focuses on one simple principle: complete at least one task every day and keep your streak alive.

## How does the streak system work?

Every day you complete at least one task, your streak increases by one. Miss a day, and it resets to zero. This simple mechanism motivates you to stay productive and build lasting habits through consistent daily progress.

## Is my data private?

Absolutely. Reminders+ uses 100% local storage — your data stays on your device and is never uploaded to any server. No account required, maximum privacy.

## What platforms is it available on?

Reminders+ is currently available on iOS. We're working on bringing it to more platforms soon.

## Is Reminders+ free?

Yes, Reminders+ is free to download and use. We believe everyone should have access to a simple, effective productivity tool.

## Does it support multiple languages?

Yes! Reminders+ includes multilingual support to help users worldwide build better habits in their preferred language.
